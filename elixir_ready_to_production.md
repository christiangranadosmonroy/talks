## Basic Do’s and Don’ts

---

### Do’s

- Choose things that can become two meals, like a soup for dinner and the next days lunch.
- Focus on recipes you enjoy cooking that are easy to make and reheat.
- Ensure the meals are balanced.
- Make it look nice so you look forward to eating it.

---

### Dont’s

- Don't prep a whole week. Start with just 1-2 meals if this is new. 3-4 days max.
- Try and do it after work or when short of time. 
- Over complicate it!

## Kitchen and Pantry Basics

![](clem-onojeghuo-97090.jpg)

---

### Knives

Invest in a single good Chef's knife, with some heft, no smaller than 20cm. Love it. Treat it with care, you will have this for 10+ years minimum. Look into Güde and Wusthof.

You should also buy a good quality sharpener and learning how to use it properly. I recommend DuoSharp.

---

### Pantry Essentials

Make sure you have the following on had at all times:

- Mild olive oil and coconut oil for cooking with 
- Fresh garlic and ginger (or jarred if you are real lazy)
- Dried ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, cinnamon, bay leaves, curry powder
- Chilli flakes
- Sea Salt
- Pepper grinder with a good quality pepper
- Soy and Fish Sauce
- Vanilla extract

---

### Food Storage Containers

- Freezer Safe
- Dishwasher Safe
- Microwavable
- Stackable
- Reusable
- Non-Leaky
